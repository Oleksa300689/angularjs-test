                title: "How Big Data Influences Our Daily Life",
                description: "The modern society is surrounded by technological trends, which change each other rapidly. It is closer than you can imagine: it's in social media, internet, future sport results forecasting, GPS navigation, banks etc. but the most interesting is awaiting us in future.",
                content: "The modern society is surrounded by technological trends, which change each other rapidly. One of those trends is the development of the Big Data. What is that? Who produces and analyzes the Big Data? How is it applied to a life of random people? We will find the answer to all those and even more questions in this article. In the world of applied science, Big Data is the complex of technologies that are aimed at performing three kinds of operations. First, process big amount of data, in comparison to a one. Second, be able to proceed, analyze and apply information that flows very fast. Third, should be able to work with both structured and unstructured data. Defining the place, where Big Data is applied, we can think about Hadron Collider that collects a huge amount of material using sensors. After that, scientists analyze collected data and work on the resolution of global problems. Some may claim that this technology is not applicable to a life of simple people, but it is closer than you can imagine. SOCIAL NETWORKS. Every person is generating dozens of Mbs of data every minute. We are using social networks, search systems, discount systems in the shops, text messaging and many other features, that provide information to the Big Computer. For example, instead of sorting the news by the date of posting, Facebook shows the most popular ones. In the same way, analyzing your activity, you receive suggestions on posts which may be interesting to you or friends you may know. This is just one of the examples of the way Big Data influences our daily life. THE INTERNET OF THINGS. One more example is the Internet of Things. This topic was described in details in one of the previous articles, and that is also a part of the Big Data revolution. Now the development of it is in the early stages, but scientists predict that we will use features of the smart life on daily basis. Your Smart Home will warm up or cool down before you come back from work. Smart Fridge will analyze amount of stuff left and order a bottle of beer for you every Friday, and every Saturday police will follow your car and check percentage of the alcohol in your blood. The self-driving car will wait for you after the work and drive you through your favorite shops, meanwhile, you will be getting advertising regarding discounts in those shops. Time should pass before it happens, while today Big Data is used in the entertainment and marketing. FUTURE FORECASTING. The Big Data also could be used for predicting results of the sports competitions, like Olympic Games. In 2012, scientists performed simulation of the Olympic Games, and stated that the US would get 108 medals, in fact, 104 medals were received by the USA during non-simulated competition. As already mentioned, Big Data analyses a huge amount of information coming from different sources. In practice, this technology may prevent epidemic of illness in one or other regions, taking into account Google searches and confidential information recorded in hospitals. GPS NAVIGATION AND PREVENTION OF TRAFFIC JAMS. The system of Smart traffic is used in the big cities, like London. Sensors in the traffic lights evaluate traffic tension and change the light color according to the need. In this way, traffic jams are reduced and citizens feel more comfortable traveling to from work during rush hours. In the same way, when you use the GPS navigation, you are forwarded to the streets where traffic tension is lower. BANK-ISSUED CREDITS AND INSURANCE SERVICES. Have you ever visited a bank in order to take a loan or apply for credit card? If yes, you probably know that it takes some time, while a bank assistants are checking your personality, credibility and financial situation. That is one more example of the Big Data applications in practice. Banks have access to information which helps to secure money and give loans only to trusted people. The same solution is used by insurance providers, as insurance rate is different for every individual. For instance, buying an insurance for a car, the insuring company analyzes your driving experience, incidents, amount of fines, etc. The Big Data provides a lot of advantages to different kinds of companies, at the same time decreasing frauds. SUMMING UP. The Big Data is a strong analyzing system that is slowly coming to all aspects of our daily life. People do not even realize how much information the Big Computer knows about every single person. Nowadays, only 5% of information is available for analyzing, but this number is increasing rapidly. Does not matter if we want it or not, the Big Data is coming into our lives. Today, only 5% of the available information can be analyzed by Big Data, so the most interesting is awaiting us in future."

                title: "Virtual Reality. Advanced Gaming Tool or Powerful Training Platform?",
                description: "For several years we are following after development of the Virtual and Augmented Reality. It have been giving us a new posibilities like dynamic storytelling, virtual education, medicine, training, sports, video gaming, virtual shopping etc. In future, most probably, it will touch much more fields of our lives than we can imagine.",
                content: "For several years we are following after development of the Virtual and Augmented Reality. In the early beginning, the VR and AR gadgets have been treated as gaming tools which would probably become wanted among children. Nowadays, companies present a wide range of software and hardware supporting Virtual and Alternative Reality. We have touched upon this topic in the previous article. In the following piece of writing, we will analyze trends of the VR and AR more specifically. DYNAMIC STORYTELLING Journalists rule the scene, especially when it comes to the presentation of the new trends. American magazines 'The New York Times', 'The Suite Life' and 'The Guardian' presented a new way of storytelling and article writing. They have presented the software, with which you may feel the news from the inside. For example, instead of reading about the camp of escapees from Syria, now you can feel as you are in there. The Suite Life grants you with a possibility to see the luxury apartments, cruise ships, private planes and the best hotels from the inside. Rather than watching photos, you could have a virtual tour of the place that you could never visit. VIRTUAL EDUCATION. Do you remember history, geography or any other lessons from the school times? Was it easy for you to understand the way how people lived in the 10th century only watching pictures? How did you feel realizing how big is the Atlantic Ocean or Sahara desert? Was not easy to do, right? Nowadays, technologies make the studying process easier and faster. Just imagine, you are a twelve-year-old pupil sitting in the classroom, and the subject of the lesson is Egypt. You are not supposed to read lots of articles, the only thing you need to do, is to wear an Optical Head-mounted display and start the adventure. You may see the process of building pyramids, Egyptian kings, and dynasties. Now you can follow all stages of the country development. Sounds fantastic, right? This is the way the education and tourism will be developing in the next few years. If you want to travel all over the world, but don't have enough money, you can benefit from Virtual Reality. Just imagine that you are walking around Paris, have fun during Carnaval in Brazil, attend wedding in the African tribble or walk inside pyramids without leaving your apartments. Time will show us if this is the new branch of tourism development or death for tourism business. VIRTUAL REALITY IN MEDICINE. As mentioned above, VR may be used not just for fun, but also in the learning processes. Using the Virtual Reality gadgets, young doctors may train the skills up to excellence, before they make injections or surgery to real patients. This system guarantees enough training experience, ability to practice on situations that rarely happen in the real life. Also, the Optical Head-mounted display can be used in the treatment of vision illnesses. James Blaha, founder of the Vivid Vision, together with his team found the way of medication the strabismus (a visual problem in which the eyes are not aligned properly and point in different directions) and vision disabilities with special software adjusted to Virtual Reality hardware. Development of this feature will help people with eyesight impairments without high-cost surgery.TRAINING FOR PILOTS and Tankmen in the VR, Improved Simulator from 1920`s or New Feature in Learning. First flight simulator for training pilots was created in the early 1920`s. With the development of the Virtual Reality, training platforms for pilots, tankmen, and soldiers in general, become more realistic and convenient. With the new tools, it is possible to simulate situations which are impossible to perform during real training or that would cost a lot of money. For example, crash of the plane above the ocean, desert or mountains, turning the tank upside down, etc. This technology gives users a real feeling of the situation and reduces stress when this occurs in reality. VIRTUAL REALITY APPLIED IN FITNESS OR A VIRTUAL FITNESS. The Black Box VR and Runtastic presented the new generation of personal fitness training. With this application, you will fill the difference between boring fitness training in gym and exciting video game, where you will perform special assignments as a main hero of the movie. For instance, you have to save a city from zombie apocalypse or robots attack, and all exercises performed in physical reality will make sense in the virtual one. Exercises are generated according to your physical condition, lifestyle and preferences, which will make exercising the way funnier and easier. NEW REALITY OF VIDEO GAMING. Of course, we cannot forget about Video Gaming, as it becomes even more realistic. VR is now applied to several kinds of the games like riding and war simulators, and horrors. Instead of just playing in front of the screen, a user is plunged into a game. Video Gaming Virtual Reality works in the same way as in training or learning processes, user experience same feelings as it was real. User may feel sick while playing riding simulator, feel in danger fighting with monsters or feel the shots. This technology definitely distracts users from the real life. AUGMENTED REALITY Augmented Reality, when physical world meets a Virtual one. On the Apple presentation, they introduced the AR tool for a smartphone camera. With this software user may place new equipment into the room or place dragon to the party. As well as, Ukrainian software engineer created an application which allows you place the tattoo on your body and check if it suits you or not. Also, she plans to develop the app, so users will be able to try accessories, closes and jewelry. LONG STORY SHORT. Virtual and Augmented reality is slowly becoming a part of our life, and in few years, most probably, we will not be able to exist without Optical Head-mounted display. Maybe we will prefer traveling in the virtual world, buying goods in the virtual shops, meeting virtual friends and playing virtual games. Most probably, VR and AR will touch much more fields of our lives than we can imagine."

                title: "Trends of the IT industry that will develop in 2018",
                description: "We are living in the time of Global changes and mass development of the technologies. Year 2018 will bring us new trends in Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, development of Human Less solutions and blockchain development. What does it mean for society in reality?",
                content: "We are living in the time of Global changes and mass development of the technologies. Sometimes it is really hard to follow all the trends, as they change each other rapidly. Few years ago we haven`t been thinking about the existence of cryptocurrency, while today even the lazy people are discussing the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. What will next years of technological development bring to us? Let's have a look at the prediction of IT trends that will shake the world in 2018.ARTIFICIAL INTELIGENCE, ROBOTICS, AUGMENTED AND VIRTUAL REALITY. Artificial intelligence is something that is being discussed everywhere, but it is not implemented by mass businesses yet. We all have heard about Siri, Alexa and human-like robot Sofia, who shook the world of technologies recently. Not everyone is aware of the fact that artificial intelligence has been existing among us for many years. One of the branches of artificial intelligence is the development of the face-detection feature that is not used only for smartphone unlocking. Basically, face detection has been used for years until now. Curious how? Have you ever noticed, that Facebook offers you to tag your friends in the photos? Also, this feature is available on every smartphone, when your photos are being sorted by people, locations, and dates. Those are examples of Artificial intelligence and face detection in action. The face recognition can be implemented into video monitoring of premises, and increasing security of Banks and ATMs. For example, in addition to password identification ATM terminal could recognize a person by face. Also, employers will be able to track how much time employees are spending at the workplaces. In order to do that, an employer will not need to spend hours next to the CCTV, the system would do it by itself and manager will get a report in the end of the certain period of the time. In the previous years, almost all the companies have been presenting Head-mounted displays. This equipment may show an image generated by computer only, or a mix of the reality and virtual reality. Some people claim that it is the next generation of expensive toys for children, while others say that it will become an important element if daily life. Experts are sure that during the next years AI, Robotics, AR, and VR will increase cooperation, offering more complementary solutions for businesses. The next year will show the new directions, in the technological development.INTERNET OF THINGS AND THE DEVELOP OF HUMAN LESS SOLUTIONS. Smart home, smart building, smart office, smart shops and storages, all those smart innovations are surrounding us over past few years. This is an outcome of the Internet of Things development. The American shop Walmart is involving smart storages and smart shelves, those innovations allow shelves and storages monitor the number of goods which is left, and create orders for things which should be added. Also, they are planning to introduce robots and drones, which will place goods from storages to shelves. Does that mean that there will be less job for humans? Managers of the shop claim the opposite, they say that new technologies will allow people to be more involved in human tasks, for example in cooperation with customers. Basically, the involvement of Human Less trends will increase the amount of workers in IT sphere and decrease requirements for people to perform physical kinds of work. BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPMENT IS NOT LIMITED TO BITCOINS. You surely have heard about the cryptocurrency but if you need more information, check out our article. The Blockchain technology is not limited to the use in the cryptocurrency development, there are more technologies based on the blockchain, that will be developing during next years. Blockchain scaling. This innovation is created to accelerate the processes without sacrificing security. Nowadays, in the blockchain, every computer takes part in the processing of every transaction. In fact, that is not efficient enough. Blockchain scaling figures out how many computers are required to validate each transaction, then operations are being divided. Scaling will add security, efficiency, and productivity to the existing blockchain system. Smart contract. While a standard contract outlines the terms of a relationship (usually one enforceable by law), a smart contract enforces a relationship using cryptographic protocol. The smart contract follows and assures implementation of the contract conditions. Now the security of the following system is not perfect, but works are ongoing. Most probably, during next few years, smart contracting will be a powerful system used by thousands of people. Also, Blockchain can be used in non-financial fields. For example, the EverLeger company uses blockchain in the supply chain, to confirm the source of origin of diamonds. At the same time, start-up Assetcha.in uses blockchain as a system of preservation of valuables. Both, well known and covered possibilities of the Blockchain will develop during next years. TO SUM UP. There was a huge development of technologies over last two decades. The world is concerned the most on the Blockchain, Virtual reality, Artificial developments, Robotics, Smart objects, and many other things that may replace important role of the human. What does it mean for society in reality? Will it make our life easier and more comfortable, or will cause problems for simple people? The answer is in the hands of developers."

                title: "A Blockchain Explanation Your Parents Will Understand",
                description: "What is the Blockchain and how is it related to Bitcoins.",
                content: "The world of technologies is changing very rapidly. Not so far ago we couldn't imagine the fact that every single person would have a mobile phone. Do you remember those moments when you had to explain your parents/grandparents how to use it? Later on, the Internet came into our daily life, and again the young generation of people had to explain to adults what is that, how to use it and so on. And in the moment, when everyone feels more or less comfortable with technologies, the blockchain revolution came into our life. And again, we struggle with the questions from our parents 'What is blockchain?', 'Who needs it and why bitcoins are so popular?', 'Can you get a couple of bitcoins for me? I would like to buy a new car', etc. Have you ever heard one of those questions? If yes, read this article and find out answers to the most common questions regarding Blockchain. WHAT IS THE BLOCKCHAIN AND HOW IS IT RELATED TO BITCOINS. In his article, Jamie Skella compared blockchain to a shared record book. This book contains information about the creation of new blocks (lines). When a new line item is created a new edition of the record book is published. This digital record book is stored in thousands of computers and synchronized as soon as the new block is created. It should be admitted that this record book doesn't have a central location from which is shared to thousands of computers. It is updated after each transaction on every computer. I would compare it to the economic or mathematical game, where everyone knows the rules, amount of the resources and conditions how do get the resource. Let's try to understand it on the example of bitcoin, the cryptocurrency created on the principle of the blockchain. The idea of bitcoins is based on the money operations without intervention from the government. There is no head of the Central Bank of Bitcoins who can take a decision. Bitcoins cannot be copied also no one can take a decision to print more of those, which makes devaluation of cryptocurrency impossible. A maximum amount of Bitcoins is 21 million. BY WHOM WAS IT CREATED? Satoshi Nakamoto created the software for Bitcoins in 2008. Using terminology of Jamie Skella, he created a record book and said: Now 1 million of bitcoins exists, buy it, sell it, go for more. Also, he (or she, or they, the real personality of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown) created rules of the game. There were few tries to uncover real personality of Satoshi. Despite the fact that in the blog he claimed to be 37 years old living in Japan, some take those facts as a false data. Satoshi writes in English fluently, as it is his mother tongue, and the Bitcoin software is not customized for Japanese. In March 2017, the Newsweek posted an article claiming that Dorian Nakamoto (American with Japanese origin), is a founder of Bitcoin - Satoshi Nakamoto. This fact had no evidence and was declined by Dorian. In May 2016, an Australian computer scientist and engineer, Craig Wright claimed that he created the Bitcoins. He also provided evidence, with records of the keys from the first transaction. But the fact is that this data could be easily found by any user of the system. Craig Wright didn`t provide any other evidence and gave up on his worlds. In the end of November 2017, some journalists were talking about Elon Musk, businessmen, founder of the SpaceX, who probably is covered by the nickname 'Satoshi Nakamoto'. This information was provided by Sahil Gupta, who performed an internship in the SpaceX. His suggestion was based on the several facts: the C++ language, which is actively used in SpaceX and by Elon Musk, was used for Bitcoin software; also Elon Musk always had a willingness to resolve global problems, Bitcoin was created in 2008 when the world financial crises started. Elon Musk refused those facts saying that the year of 2008 was the most unsuccessful for him, he would not have time and possibilities for creation of such a great software. SO HOW CAN I GET THE BITCOINS? There are few different ways of getting Bitcoin: you can buy it from other users, sell some goods for Bitcoin, buy it on the Bitcoin market or start mining the Bitcoins. The process is very similar to oil production: the more oil is being in use,  the less is left and the conditions of production are tauter. Sounds weird, right? Of course, bitcoins are not oil, gold or coal BUT principle created by Satoshi Nakamoto is very similar to the one working on the oil production. We have bitcoins instead of oil and computer instead of a person. In order to get bitcoins, the person needs to open a new block. As a result, we have the computer which is working on creating a special, let us say password (hash), which will fulfill all conditions and create a new block (new line in the record book). The condition for opening every new block is more complicated than for previous one. Once the block is opened, miner gets the reward -  the certain amount of bitcoins. And it may last until the time when all bitcoins are founded. DOES IT MEANS, THAT I CAN MINE BITCOINS FROM MY LAPTOP? Only if you find a time machine. In 2009 it was more than enough to use a simple laptop for mining of Bitcoins. With time process becomes more and more complicated. Since 2013 mining without special equipment became not cost effective. The cost of electricity which is used during mining is higher than an average income. Also, there are some gossips about the Bitcoin Farms, where computers with huge capability are earning millions of Dollars for owners of the Farm. In order to create something like that, there is a need to invest around $9 000 000 in the equipment, to get around $1 000 000 of monthly income. HOW MUCH CAN BE EARNED BY MINING? The amount of Bitcoins which could be earned by mining is divided by 2, every 4 years. In 2009 you would get 50 BTC, after second decreasing, in July 2016, the remuneration for mining is 12.5 BTC. By 2031 it is should be less than 1 Bitcoin, it will last until the time when all 21 million of BTC is mined. DOES GOVERMENT HAVE ANY KIND OF CONTROL ON CRYPTOCURRENCY? Status of the bitcoin is different around the globe. It is being classified as a cryptocurrency, money surrogate, non-material goods, virtual product, etc. In Japan, Bitcoin is a legal payment method. In China, Bitcoin is a virtual product, not currency, which means that only individuals, not banks, can perform transactions. In Australia, Bitcoin is treated as a property and any transaction as a barter. The first Bitcoin bank was created in Austria in February 2017. There is special ATM where you can exchange cryptocurrency to Euro, and in another way around - exchange Euro to Bitcoin. Similar ATMs exist also in some Asian countries and Ukraine, despite the fact that status of the Bitcoin in Ukraine is not defined yet. SUMMARIZING THE ABOVE. The Blockchain is a record book, where each transaction is documented in the new line(block). Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, each transaction with which is recorded in the Blockchain. To map a transaction, new block should be opened by miners. When a new block is opened, miners get a reward - certain amount of bitcoins. The system is quite simple in understanding. The only question remains open - how will it develop in future. Will it be a big step to the new future or system will just crush and something new will be introduced? What we can know for sure, is that future will surprise us."

                description: "What is a CMS?",
                content: "Developing a CMS is more than an attempt to keep up with the Joneses, nowadays, it is the first business necessity. One of the factors that contribute to the CMS popularity is that it can be set up in the world network with basic programming knowledge. WHAT IS A CONTENT MANAGMENT SYSTEM? CMS In A Nutshell. A Content Management System is an application that helps to customize, manage, and create information. There are CMSs that can be used alone and some that are usually applied in a conjunction with the others. You can request a CMS that would work on your network, on the Internet, or run locally on your personal computer. The CMS is a key to the quick buildup of a powerful website that would help with maintenance and customization. Keeping that in mind, you should figure out what you need. The following questions might help you: What exactly do you need? Something like a blog or an online shop? What do you want in your CMS? What functions do you want to fulfill in the system? In Inoxoft, developers gained expertise in building the CMSs used all over the world. CMS is a shortcut to creating a high-quality multifunctional management system in a short period. We know that there is no one size fits all solution, but the existing ones are great, too. WHAT CMS TH CHOOSE FOR E-COMMERCE? Popular open source CMSs and what is so attractive about them WordPress CMS benefits: 60 mln websites around the globe were built on WordPress CMS base a multiplicity of visual and functional plugins in an open source platform an abundance of e-commerce solutions used for large-scale websites, quick and easy customization ,Drupal CMS advantages perfectly suited for content, marketing, improved security features, Drupal CMS features fit for corporate websites, Magento CMS design: is it worth it? 200 000 corporate websites worldwide are built on Magento CMS base perfect for store administration, easy augmentation of functionality with the add-ons If your ideas cannot be implemented with the already-made CMSs, a software development company can build it up from scratch. Surely, it will take more time and money, but it will definitely perfectly fit all your needs. Traditionally, the custom CMSs are written in .Net, PHP, and Python languages. So what? Wait, here comes an explanation. CONTENT MANAGMENT SYSTEM COMPARISON. .NET vs Python vs PHP based content management systems PHP based CMS suits for writing programs of any size,  extensive support of database, works on the majority of platforms and operational systems, Zend, Yahoo, Facebook, Google, NASA, Python CMS runs on multiple systems and platforms programing-driven and object-oriented Yahoo Map, Linux Weekly News, Shopzilla .Net based for building large web applications writing the dynamic web pages, applications, and services The software for Microsoft operating system is traditionally written with the .Net platform as it includes an abundance of Microsoft technologies and services like Azure Cloud storage, MS QL DB, and others. Talking about the iOS and Android mobile applications, it's important to admit that the applications run more efficiently when they are written for two separate operating systems. Writing on the cross-platform usually results in a rising number of glitches caused by the database inconsistencies."

                content: "Spirit of innovations Web Summit 2017 gathered about 61k people. Standing on the edge of latest inventions in the tech world, they were trying to raise the curtain and see what is yet to come. There was enough space for everyone: developers, investors, digital nomads, freelancers, business and brand developers, designers and many others were soaking inspiration from countless events, exciting and, sometimes, terrifying speeches, and the general atmosphere. Lisbon was literally breathing with WebSummit, bright were stickers leading you right to the venue, some people were rushing busily for the meetings, meanwhile, the others were searching for the meeting point for one of the summits (like surf, night, sunset-summits, etc.). Fascinating booths of promising startups and famous companies did their best to make people stop by and wonder. It was fun taking photos with the animated AR characters at the Google booth, literally see your blood flow using the tablet, and drink spectacularly represented coffee made by Delta Cafes. Interacting with the cutting-edge technologies for even once was worth more than hearing about them for thousand times. CYBERSECURITY TRUMP, SELF-DRIVING CARS. About 1.2 k speakers made a lot agitation around the burning topics such as cybersecurity, climate change, and latest presidential elections in the US. High profile people were eager to share their vision on the individual security, prospects of the AR, AI, self-driving cars, and changes they will bring about. Brian Krzanich (Intel CEO), Mark Hurd (Oracle CEO), Brad Smith (president of Microsoft) tried to raise the curtain of the unknown, talk about failures and share their own predictions.  ATTRACTING INVESTMENTS. One of the things that remain in the memory is that among the usual as well as the fairly extraordinary company and startup booths, one could also mention the full-grown monumental stands of countries. The colorful stands representing Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Poland, Kazakhstan and a number of other countries showed strong support of the governments and the exhibition of interest in the development of the IT sphere. That is what we have found to be inspiring and supportive. WHY COME BACK? Web Summit is fascinating, inspiring, and thrilling, but if those words mean nothing to you, we have other reasons. The events are so diverse, you will definitely find a bunch of them to attend. Want it or not, you will meet many people from your sphere or from the related ones and even more people from non-related spheres. So, you will experience the networking in its purest form. Knowledge sharing is another thing to go for: speakers, high profile people, and usual attendees will be more than ready to share their experience and give a piece of advice. To end, Lisbon itself is a charming spot on earth to visit."

                title: "Outsourcing vs Outstaffing: What's So Good About Hiring A Team For Your Project",
                description: "In IT sphere, the collaboration with the outsourcing company plays an important role. To leave a client satisfied, IT companies conduct the full cycle of product development. Bouth: the outsoursing and outstaffing has their riscs and benefits.",
                content: "The 21st century is the best thing that could happen to the business of all times. We have video calls and conferences, communicate via emails and multiple professional social networks and this is a pleasure no businessmen could imagine in the past. The engagement models have transformed so much that it's hard to collect ten people who wouldn't work in a company providing outsource or outstaffing services. In this digest, we will discuss the differences between the outsourcing and outstaffing: two major types of B2B collaboration popular on the modern market. Before we launch our, which is better outsourcing or outstaffing tirade, let's refresh our knowledge about the two notions. In IT sphere, the collaboration with the outsourcing company looks in the following way: a service provider (an IT company) and a client sign an agreement that states that the service provider is responsible for the quality and process of development of a particular software. An outsourcing team is comprised of the well-synchronized members who have already worked with one another. The outsourcing company then provides a project with the PM, a required number of developers and manages the process from the beginning to an end. Things go differently when it comes to outstaffing since an outstaffing company is a supplier of the human resource. The core idea of outstaffing is to escalate the size of the existing team of the partners in the shortest time possible. In addition, in outsourcing an employee can only work for one company on a full-time equivalent job base, meanwhile, in outstaffing, an employee can work for different companies being hired till the project is over. OUTSOURSING VS OUTSTAFFING: WHAT'S THE BEST FOR THE CLIENT? Outsourcing is better for the majority of businesses as it predicts more determination and responsibility from the IT companies. The high-quality and the satisfactory result of the collaboration directly affects the reputation of a company. In other words, the better the result - the more clients a company attracts. To leave a client satisfied, IT companies conduct the full cycle of product development: beginning from the business analysis, estimations, status meetings and ending with the product testing. OUTSOUCING: PROS AND CONS: An on-time delivery of the project, good communication with the client, regular status meetings, rapid response to occurring problems, providing additional services like personal testing, PM, no time overlaps. PUTSTAFFING: BENEFITS AND RISKS: the project employees are coordinated by PMs, time gaps and overlaps are more likely to occur, each outstaff member is responsible only for one, improved scalability of team, Surely, the outstaffing companies are responsible for insurance, taxation, and official employment but they carry less responsibility for personnel management and quality of the rendered services. Whereas, the outsourcing companies cover the entire scope of issues and services providing the high-quality human resources. WHERE OUTSOURCING FOR RECRUITMENT WOULD BE AN ADVANTAGE? The decision to outsource a product is complicated as software development companies would rather develop in-house and would consider extending the company size. What does outsourcing give you? Looking at the practice of the IT countries where outsourcing is most popular, Ukraine, Poland, and Hungary, to be precise, it is possible to conclude that the main drive to outsource to them is that they are cost-effective, experienced, and geographically and culturally proximate. Thus, it will give your business more time to concentrate on your main job a guarantee for a high-quality end-product.

                description: "There is a lot of things you need to know, to find a good contractor. Country, salary, qualification are very important factors. Your contractor is in Ukraine. The cheap project development accompanied by the high quality is what each startup searches for.",
                content: "New to finding a contractor for the project? We know that selecting a contractor for your project is quite a challenging task. You do need 'the one' who knows how to do the things right. Your business is like no other and you won't be satisfied with a standard approach nevertheless, you aren't ready to pay extra for creativity? No worries, there are a lot of fish in the sea. Our journey on how to select a contractor for a project begins with tackling the main challenge: price-quality-time balance. We all know that one has to either donate money to get a high-quality software fast or pay less but receive the project way later. PRICE AS A GEOPOLITICAL VECTOR FOR YOUR BUSINESS. The statistics show that the welfare of the country defines the price of the software development. The high density of developers does not promise the high quality of the product development. India shows the dramatic decline of the software development sector even though the prices for development are surprisingly low. Still, the best quality is characteristic of the countries with the moderate and higher prices. So, where does a meridian fall? It falls on the  Eastern European countries that border the quantitatively superior but qualitatively inferior East from the Western European countries. MONEY-BOND: HOW MUCH YOU SHOULD PAY YOUR TEAM. Startups suffer the insufficiency of constant funding. That is why the development of software should be successful from the first attempt. The last three years show a positive tendency of increasing quality of software development in Ukraine. The country took the 11th place in the International Outsource Rating. In Ukraine, an average salary of a developer as well as the overall estimation of the project price are lower than in Western European countries. Meanwhile, the quality is considerably higher than in Eastern Asian countries. TIGHT TIME LIMITATIONS IN STARTUPS. The startup directors are pressed with time and need a speedy and glitchless performance of software/application. Time is a matter of money,  the one who cares about the quick delivery should be prepared to spend more on the project development, no matter what size of des team is required. The quick project development is conducted by the senior developers, meanwhile, a longer one would be managed by the juniors. The  Ukrainian senior developers earn less than the  Western European ones. SO WHERE IS YOUR CONTRACTOR? Your contractor is in Ukraine. The cheap project development accompanied by the high quality is what each startup searches for. Inoxoft has a flexible approach to the development of the custom software offering different price generation strategies and building the specific team of developers."

                description: "Native and cross-platform development are similar, but quite different. The developers find the native apps more convenient to work with as they can be built with the system tools and in a shorter time. The thing is that they are built with the system's templates and surprise with the smooth UX. Cross-platform development, meanwhile is too young. So, native app development remains the best practice in the modern market as it provides sleek navigation around the app.",
                content: "The Big Question: why native app development or why cross-platform mobile development? Before we dwell upon pros and cons of native and cross-platform mobile application development, let's make some points clear. WHAT IS NATIVE DEVELOPMENT? Native mobile apps are created for a single mobile platform installed on the device. Cross-platform mobile apps are built with different combinations of languages to suit different mobile platforms. WHAT IS CROSS-PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT? Cross-platform mobile app development appeared as an alternative to the comparatively expensive native app development. Imagine that you have a unique idea for a mobile application: it would work wonders for your business, satisfy all clients, and increase income dramatically. All of your target audience/consumers actively use their mobile phones and that's great news because you can head to the closest software developer. Bad news, you only have money to pay only for the iOS or Android mobile app. And that's pretty bad news. But, wait, here comes a hero  - the cross-platform mobile app development. Some more details about the types of the cross-platform mobile apps: Hybrid apps are the usual web pages built with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript and a variety of tools. The PhoneGap is one of the frameworks that bridge the native SDK with the JavaScript WebView. Mobile websites (also known as mobile responsive) that look like apps. They are not listed in your menu because you access them via a mobile browser. Mobile apps that utilize their runtime to run different programming languages. As soon as they launch an app, it runs a virtual machine that triggers the cross-platform code execution. The most popular platform for this app type is Titanium. Mobile apps that execute the cross-platform code ingrained into the native code. This type of apps is often developed on the Xamarine platform. CROSS PLATFORM VS.NATIVE DEVELOPMENT. The Big Question: why native app development or why cross-platform mobile development? The choice is always after you and we are here to help you with your choice. Let's analyze the advantages and limitations of both native and cross-platform development to see what type suits you. Native app development pros: Works with the built-in features of the device which means that they perform faster and easier. Users can easily find and download the apps from the markets as the native apps usually have better support from the interested marketplaces. Before an app is placed on the market, it is being checked for the safety and security to get the market's approval. The developers find the native apps more convenient to work with as they can be built with the system tools and in a shorter time. The native apps feel very natural to the system in which they operate. The thing is that they are built with the system's templates and surprise with the smooth UX. Native app development cons: The native apps cost more as they have to be absolutely compatible with the other platforms and devices. Talking about the maintenance, it's important to mention that the native apps are more expensive to support, especially when one application supports two and more platforms. With the native apps, there is a risk of losing time as it has to be approved to enter a marketplace. Plus, there is no guarantee that it will instantly become popular among the users. Cross-platform application development pros: In case the code was carefully planned, 50%-80% of it may be reused in the cross-platform. This results in decreased costs and time of development. During the maintenance period, the bugs are fixed in a common codebase only. Perfectly suits the business process automation and B2B apps because there, the time, not the user experience plays the main role. Cross-platform application development cons: UX is a pretty important thing and it lags behind when it comes to cross-platform mobile app development. The thing is that the desktops are more powerful than the phones since the phones have less processing power. Consequently, the HTML5 hybrid apps show poor UX performance on the middle and low range phones. The cross-platform apps consume more battery than the native ones because they require the rendering of the advanced features that need a lot of GPU and CPU resources rendered by the latest CSS and HTML. Pretty often, the cross-platform apps need to act in a call-back manner to communicate with the native plugins which only makes the code more complicated. There is also a high probability of making-cross platform mobile business apps too slow. Now that we know the weak and strong points of the Native and Cross-platform app development, it's possible to draw a line and see what really works in practice. So, is native development dead? Even though the future is after the cross-platform app development, now it is far from ideal and it causes more inconveniences that ease the process of development. Thus, we can state that currently, the native app development is a better choice for your business. When it comes to the success of your business, you have to be ready to spend more. Surely, the development of two separate native applications for one mobile system is more expensive than making a cross-platform one but what really decides the success is the superior UX. Ordering a cross-platform development means that you're saving on the overall cost of the development, however, losing on the quality of the UX. What's UX? User Experience is a set of advantages that an average user sees using an app. Statistics say that the UX is a driving force of success as it determines whether the user will return to using an application or leave it far behind. Statistically, after the third time an application malfunctions, users delete it. The mobile systems have their differentiating features such as the location of the buttons and the way you navigate around the application and, finally, what kind of impression this application leaves. If the user comes back to using it and finds the layout logical and easy to use, the UX is positive and efficient. Finally, the cross-platform apps are better for the B2B solutions as they offer a wider range of functions. Those who aim at a direct communication with the clients tend to order the native app development as it guarantees the efficient UX and UI. Fortunately or not, the cross-platform app development is still in the process of dynamic development and suffers from the rising number of inconsistencies, technology-wise. Native app development remains the best practice in the modern market as it provides sleek navigation around the app. Inoxoft specialists have proven to provide the smooth functioning native apps for Android and iOS systems. We would be pleased to help you with your idea for a native mobile app idea just share your vision with us!"
